# Dodge-Me
An Automated Nerf Turret that can track human faces and orient itself to shoot at them, creating a new Human-Toy Interaction that can stimulate reflex responses from the user.Combining computer vision &amp; physical computing to explore novel ideas of entertainment!

The codes given are divided into 2 parts. One for the arudino which will be running on the arduino and another for Open CV which will be running on your computer. The open CV  code needs to be setup after enabling serial communication between the arduino and the computer. Once the code detects the face, it will send instructions to create a red box around the face on the computer screen. The computer then send the co-ordinates of the face to the arduino to intiate the servo to centre itself to the face. When the position of the face changes, the new co-ordinates are send and this loop continues and once the face is centered, the firing mechanism wil be triggered to shoot the nerf bullet.
